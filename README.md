Malaria Image Classification Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a malaria image classification project. The goal is to develop and evaluate a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying images of malaria-infected cells. The analysis includes:

Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the dataset for training.
Model Development: Details on the architecture and training of the classification model.
Evaluation Metrics: Methods used to assess the performance of the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Insights and Visualizations: Key findings and visualizations from the analysis to understand the model's performance and behavior.
This project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of various techniques for malaria diagnosis and to contribute to advancements in automated medical image analysis.
